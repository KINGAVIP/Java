JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity.
JDBC is a API or tool used in java applications to connect and interact with database.
Why Advanced Java?
    through concepts of core java we can build applications that run on a single 
    system known as standalone applications.
    Hence to remove this restrictions and build more practical applications we use 
    concepts of Advanced java.

3 primarily components of Advanced java are - JSP, Servlets and JDBC

JSP stands for Java Server Pages where the pages are considered as view components 
known as presentation logic (eg- login.jsp, home.jsp)

Servlet is meant for internal processing going on such as reading, fetching values from
the database, comparison etc in the backend as processing logic in our process servlet.
Servlets do not contain java classes for this background processing for processing logic

JDBC is meant for Connectivity of Java applications in servlets as discussed to the database.
